# YouTube Downloader with Animated Progress Bar

This is a Python program that downloads YouTube videos using a graphical interface built with `tkinter` and the `yt_dlp` library. It features an animated green progress bar that updates in real-time to show the overall download progress and displays a final message (in both English and Arabic) when all downloads are complete.

  - A text area for entering multiple YouTube video links (one link per line).
  - An animated progress bar that updates as videos are being downloaded.
  - A "Download Videos" button to start the download process.
  - A "GITHUB" button that opens the developer's GitHub page.
  - A "Created by: Abdelrhaman" label.

- **Animated Progress Bar:**  
  The progress bar moves continuously to reflect the download progress of each video, showing the current overall percentage.

- **Multi-threaded Downloads:**  
  Downloads run in a separate thread to keep the interface responsive.

- **Real-time Progress Updates:**  
  Utilizes `yt_dlp`'s progress hook to update the progress bar with the current video's download percentage.
